# Original Readme

# Bar

Personal [Übersicht](http://tracesof.net/uebersicht/) system information bar for use with [Kwm](https://github.com/koekeishiya/kwm) window manager.
Originally created by [herrbischoff](https://github.com/herrbischoff), inspired by my NerdTool configuration.
I have modified the bar since then, and updated the screenshot.

The original widget created by *herrbischoff* can be found [here](https://github.com/herrbischoff/nerdbar.widget).
